					<description><![CDATA[Haputhale: Lipton's Seat]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>In 2015 my family decided to take a vacation to Srilanka because we wanted to experience something new and exciting. We had heard from friends that Srilanka was beautiful, so we thought it would be the perfect destination for our next trip. After researching online, we discovered that Lipton’s Seat Haputhale was the most popular tourist destination in Srilanka and looked like the best place to stay on the island because of its great service and hotel amenities. So I packed my bags and we took off for Lipton’s Seat Haputhale, hoping it would live up to our expectations.</strong></p>
