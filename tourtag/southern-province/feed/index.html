					<description><![CDATA[Galle: Dutch Fort]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Dutch ruled over much of the island nation of Sri Lanka during the 17th century, and their heritage can still be seen to this day. This article will take you on a tour of Sri Lanka’s Galle Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the island’s best-preserved examples of Dutch architecture. Along the way, you’ll learn about the history of the fort and its role in protecting ships from pirates—including why it’s not just one but two separate structures that are both called the Galle Fort.</strong></p>
