Here are some tips for visiting this historic site safely and effectively.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The City Of Polonnaruwa Was Once The Capital Of The Sinhalese Kingdom, Built By King Vijayabahu I In The 12th Century. The Most Iconic Building From This Time Period Is The Gal Viharaya, An Ancient Buddhist Temple (That Has Been Converted Into A Hindu Temple). The Structure Itself Was Built To Replicate The Great Stupa At Anuradhapura, So It Can Also Be Called The Small Anuradhapura Temple.

					<description><![CDATA[Anuradhapura: Ruwanweli Seya]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Ruwanweli Maha Seya, also known as the Mahathupa located in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. Two quarts or one Dona of the Buddha&#8217;s relics are enshrined in the stupa, making it the largest collection of his relics anywhere. It was built by Sinhalese King Dutugemunu.<br />
This is very calm place and also very good place to do meditation. There will be unexpected crowd during poya days. Also, I prefer to visit early in the morning or after 6 pm. There will be no rush during that time and able to do worshiping peacefully.</strong></p>
